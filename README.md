This repo is a fork for the original machinamentum's repo availible at: https://github.com/machinamentum/CTR64
I created this repo for conservation purposes and to test and improve the code without compromising the original's direction.

Feel free to post commits to this repo, if any improvement is done here it should be later informed to the original to rejoin the project.
If the direction taken by this repo is far from the original, then we have created art.
